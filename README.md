Experiment for measuring health improvement
We can create an experiment that test the change of the resting heart rate of the user. We will allow multiple potential customer to access our treadmill for an hour a day. Users can also provide feedback on our products to further improve on our products. After 3 months, we will gather the resting heart rate of the users again. The change in resting heart rate from beginning to end would indicate the improvement of usersâ€™ health.
